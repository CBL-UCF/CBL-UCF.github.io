## Anatomically-guided deep learning model for LV geometry generation with UQ
The Python implementation for [“Anatomically-guided Deep Learning for Left Ventricle Geometry Generation with Uncertainty Quantification based on Short-axis MR Images."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623001963) can be found at:

## Cardiac kinematics Phantom
We have developed a method for [“Estimating Aggregate Cardiomyocyte Strain Using In Vivo Diffusion and Displacement Encoded MRI.”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8792099). In order to test our method and quantify the effect of noise and of the image processing pipeline, we have developed a code to simulate a mid left ventricular (LV) slice motion in an analytical phantom and generate the corresponding DENSE data. By using the phantom analytical solution as “ground truth”, we have been able to identify the image requirements for computing strains within a prescribed confidence interval. The code to simulate mid LV motion and generate the corresponding MR DENSE images can be downloaded from our public github repository here:

# Computational Soft Matter (SMoL) group
The following codes have been developed in collaboration with the group of [Dr. Dharmavaram at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/sanjay-dharmavaram).

## Finite Element C++ research code
Based on the original code [voom](https://github.com/wsklug/voom) from Dr. William Klug at UCLA, we have developed an in-house C++ finite element code named voom2. This code has been used, for example, in the following publication [A Lagrangian Thin-Shell Finite Element Method for Interacting Particles on Fluid Membranes](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/12/10/960). If you are interested in using this code, please feel free to download it from our public github repository at:
