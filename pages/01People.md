### Luigi E. Perotti

<img style="float: right;" src="../assets/img/people/luigi.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
<div style="text-align: justify"> Dr. Perotti received his Laurea (B.S./M.S.) in Civil Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology. His graduate studies focused on developing new finite element methods for thin shells and on solving high-rate fluid-solid interaction problems. As a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA, he applied the continuum and computational mechanics tools he learned during his Ph.D to understand the electrophysiology and mechanics of the healthy and failing heart and the conformational changes occurring during the maturation of viral capsids. As an Assistant professor at the University of Central Florida in the MAE department, Dr. Perotti continues the study of cardiac kinematics and function by combining computational mechanics and medical images (e.g., MR and CT). Furthermore, he and his group explore thin shell morphing structures inspired by the maturation of viral capsids.</div>

<img style="float: right;" src="../../assets/img/people/wasif.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">

<div style="text-align: justify">Wasif received his B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). He has a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree specializing in developing efficient algorithms for particle cluster triangulation and visualization based on physical interactions. He has excellent experience working with C/C++ and Python with a decent knowledge of data structures and algorithms. The goal of his current research is to create elasticity inspired compact unfolding of 3D shapes. This type of unfolding will open doors for efficient deployable structures design. </div>

<img style="float: right;" src="../../assets/img/people/uditha.png" width="42%" height="42%">
<div style="text-align: justify">Uditha received his B.Sc and M.Sc in Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. For his undergraduate thesis, he worked on homogenization of woven composites for deployable space structures using multiscale modeling techniques. For his masters thesis, he investigated the non-linear bending behaviour of ultra thin woven composites at the meso-mechanical scale. Currently, he is pursuing his Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering. The goal of his research is to investigate the ventricular motion in active contraction and reveal how cellular and meso-scale changes are reflected in ventricular function and dysfunction. </div>
